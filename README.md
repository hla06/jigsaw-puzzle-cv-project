# Jigsaw Puzzle Project - Phase 1

This repository contains the implementation of Milestone 1 for the ASU/UEL Computer Vision Project.
The aim of Phase 1 is to preprocess puzzle piece images, enhance edges, clean noise, and generate masks 
for use in contour-based matching in Phase 2.

## How to Run Phase 1

1. Place the dataset in the following structure:

Jigsaw Puzzle Dataset/
└── Gravity Falls/
    ├── puzzle_2x2/
    ├── puzzle_4x4/
    ├── puzzle_8x8/

2. Run the notebook:
   `image_phase_1.ipynb`

3. Output images will be saved in:
   `processed_images/enhanced`
   `processed_images/masks`

## Files included
- Phase 1 submission notebook
- Python version of pipeline
- Phase 1 report (PDF)
